## Welcome to Acme Web Design website  

This is another incredible project from **_Brad Traversy_**. Thanks to him, we can practice how to build a responsive mobile-friendly *HTML5* website from scratch. 


As a big fan of _**Traversy Media**_, I can assure that this project is must-do for all beginners.
This is an amazing tutorial to practice using **semantic HTML** tags and **CSS**.


Within this project we learned how to build a development strategy and to follow it step by step through  *branching*. 

Feel free to check out the workflow of this project  ðŸš€ðŸ’»
